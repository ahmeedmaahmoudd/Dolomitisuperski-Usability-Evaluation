## 📖 About the Project

This project involves a **comprehensive usability evaluation** of the Dolomiti Superski website. We analyzed its interface in terms of accessibility, content structure, visual design, and overall user satisfaction.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Heuristic Inspection

We applied **Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics** and the **MiLE (Milano Lugano Evaluation) Methodology** to assess:

- Navigation and interaction
- Content quality and structure
- Presentation and visual consistency

### User Testing

We conducted user testing with 15 participants (age 20–30), each performing 5 tasks:
- Account creation & login
- Searching for discounts
- Finding ski insurance
- Locating ski school info
- Purchasing ski passes

User behavior was monitored via screen recordings and post-task questionnaires.

## 📊 Findings

### Key Usability Issues Identified

- ❌ Lack of real-time error validation
- ❌ Unclear feedback messages (e.g., “Invalid user”)
- ❌ Language switcher hidden at the bottom
- ❌ Cluttered pages with information overload
- ❌ Inconsistent filtering and visual elements

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Add breadcrumbs to all pages  
- Provide intuitive error messages and real-time input validation  
- Move the language switcher to the top and expand language support  
- Streamline the search bar with auto-suggestions  
- Reduce information overload and improve page hierarchy  
- Use clearer icons and ensure visual consistency  

---

## 📈 Results

- **Heuristic Evaluation Score:** 3.55/5  
- **User Testing Success Rate:** 85.3%  
- **Best Performing Category:** Navigation (avg. score 3.78)  
- **Main Pain Point:** Presentation (avg. score 3.4)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

While the website is visually appealing and navigable, improvements in **error handling, consistency**, and **content simplification** are crucial to optimizing the user experience. Both inspection and user feedback highlighted the same core problems, reinforcing the need for design revisions.
